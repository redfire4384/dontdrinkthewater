    <h1>The Truth of Millwater</h1>

    <div class="note">
        <p>"Don't drink the water's truth lies beneath Millwater."</p>
        
        <p>The history of Millwater, as shared by the townsfolk and taught in schools, is but a half-told tale. My discoveries led me to ancient manuscripts buried deep under the town library. These scripts speak of an underground reservoir - a source from which Millwater draws its waters. But this reservoir is not ordinary; it was once a sacred site where ancient rituals took place, some say, to communicate with other realms or even to gain unnatural longevity.</p>

        <p>Over the decades, powerful members of the town's council, aware of this secret, began using the reservoir for personal gains. Mixing certain herbs and concoctions, they could manipulate the thoughts and memories of the townsfolk. The phrase 'Don't drink the water' wasn't just a warning against potential toxins; it was a cry for help, an attempt to warn others of the council's manipulations.</p>
        
        <p>It is no surprise that they came after me once I got close to their secrets. I urge whoever reads this to spread the truth, to ensure Millwater's citizens are not just pawns in a game played by the powerful few. Find the reservoir, and you will find the truth.</p>
