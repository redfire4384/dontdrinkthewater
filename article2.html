            <p>In a grisly discovery, dozens of dead ducks were found floating lifelessly at the local pond. Their bodies bore strange markings, leading some to believe they were used in some forbidden rites. The water turned black, and a heavy mist now shrouds the area at night.</p>

Last heard, he'd unearthed forbidden knowledge about Millwater's origins - a secret so dark, it might have cost him his very soul. Whispered legends talk of a book he found, with the power to summon the town's most malevolent spirits.</p>

            <h2>Symbols of the Damned Mark the Town</h2>
            <p>The eerie symbols graffitiing the town have been identified as ancient sigils of summoning and containment.
